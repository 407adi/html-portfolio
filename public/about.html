<h1>ABOUT ME ....</h1>
<p>Hey Everyone! I am Aditi Singh and i am a web developer. Currently I am doing my graduation in computer scince 
  from Bits Pilani. I just completed my first year. Talkinga about my knoweldge in codding field i have a good 
  knowledge of python , c , jave and html till now. </p>

<p>Many of you thinking now that how a girl getting interest in codding and all , because many of peolple think 
  the codding things are not for the girls. Well I got interest in codding when i was in 11th standard. I opt cs 
  as external subject. Telling honestly in starting i just hate computer science but when i started to understanding 
  the concept then i didn't find any subject more intersting. 
  My Mantra for life is "try try but don't cry!!"
